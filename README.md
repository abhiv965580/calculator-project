# Description:
This Repo introduces the Calculator Project from the Odin Project's Foundation course. It allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

## Feature:

- Decimal number operations can also be done with this project
- Floating numbers are accurate up to three decimal digits
- Also added a mouse hover effect on buttons using CSS only
- Result screen can show up to 10 digits
